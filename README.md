# weather-app
Live version of the app is **here**: https://weather-app-p.netlify.app/

## But...
If you want to test the app on your local machine you have to run **`npm install`** first to install the dependencies. Then you can run **`npm start`** to start a development server on http://localhost:3000. 
Also you can build the app with **`npm run build`** .
This will build the app for production to the `build` folder
